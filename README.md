## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

3. Run the popup alert script in a separate terminal:
    ```
    python popup_alert.py
    ```

4. Share the URL with others:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000/
    ```

When someone visits the URL, you will get a popup alert on your laptop showing the timestamp, URL visited, and IP address.
